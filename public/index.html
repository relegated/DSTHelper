                In 2014, Utah conducted a survey regarding the public desire among residents of the state surrounding Daylight Saving Time.
                  The result of this survey can be found in <a href="https://le.utah.gov/interim/2014/pdf/00004778.pdf">this pdf</a>.
                  The vast majority of individuals expressed dissatisfaction with switching every six months, with the majority of respondents 
                  desiring to align with Arizona, a state that is permanently on Mountain Standard Time.
                <br><br>
                For years, nothing happened.
                <br><br>
                Finally, in 2020, a bill sponsored by Utah State Senator Wayne Harper was passed.  The text of the bill can be found 
                  <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2020/bills/static/SB0059.html">here</a>. The basic idea is that Utah will transition to 
                  permanent Daylight Saving Time, provided two major conditions are met:
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>The United States law (USC Sec 261) must be modified to allow states to use Daylight Saving Time year round (currently, states may either use standard time with no switch, or they may use the federal-prescribed dates for switching).</li>
                    <li>At least four other “western” states (besides Utah) must adopt year-round Daylight Saving time. (Western states are defined as Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming).</li>
                </ol>
